# Creative AI Workshop

In this workshop we're going to play with some applications of AI for generation.



## Exercise 1 - Style Transfer

If you have not already done so, setup Python, Tensorflow and Keras on your machine.  Install links can be found [here](../setup.md).

Make an image of the Hogeschool Rotterdam in the style of Van Gogh.  Use the Keras example [here](https://github.com/computerscienceretreat/keras/blob/master/examples/neural_style_transfer.py).


Experiment with chaning:
* style loss
* content loss
* total variation loss

What do these things do?



## Exercise 2 - Style Transfer

Change the style of your profile picture



## Exercise 3 (optional)

Try changing the gram matrix to be a different function of the features.  Can you get similar results?  Check out this [paper](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0310.pdf)


## Final Exercise - create!
